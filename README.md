## Natural Language Processing
What you will learn:

1) Use logistic regression, na√Øve Bayes, and word vectors to implement sentiment analysis, complete analogies & translate words.

2) Use dynamic programming, hidden Markov models, and word embeddings to implement autocorrect, autocomplete & identify part-of-speech tags for words.

3) Use recurrent neural networks, LSTMs, GRUs & Siamese networks in Trax for sentiment analysis, text generation & named entity recognition.

4) Use encoder-decoder, causal, & self-attention to machine translate complete sentences, summarize text, build chatbots & question-answering.
